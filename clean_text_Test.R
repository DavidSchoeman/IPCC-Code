21 B.2.1 Anthropogenic climate change has exposed ocean and coastal ecosystems to conditions unprecedented
22 over centuries to millennia (very high confidence). Warming is causing shifts in species abundance and
23 community composition, from plankton to fish as well as shifts in distribution by latitude (30 to 55 km per
24 decade since pre-industrial) and depth, and changes in seasonal timing (from 4.5 to 6.0 days per decade
25 earlier), in every ocean region (high to very high confidence). These responses have caused habitat loss,
26 population declines, increased risks of local extirpations and reorganisation of marine food webs. (medium to
27 high confidence). {3.2.2, 3.2.3, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 3.4.4, 11.3.2, Table 11-6, 13.1, 15.3, 16.x, CCP1.2.1, CCP4.1.4,

30 B.2.2 A wide range of marine ecosystems have been impacted by extreme events, superimposed on long-
31 term climate-driven changes (very high confidence). Widespread impacts caused by marine heatwaves in
32 coastal systems include extensive coral bleaching and mortality, other mass mortalities, decline of kelp
33 forests, loss or restructuring of seagrass-meadow habitat, arrival of new species (including invasive species),
34 and shifts in community structure across many marine systems. (very high confidence). {3.4.2, 5.9.3, 11.3.2,
35 16.x, Cross-Chapter Box EXTREMES in Chapter 2}
36
37 B.2.3 Climate warming exacerbates the ecological consequences of land-based nutrient pollution and
38 formation of low-oxygen (dead) zones in coastal areas (medium confidence). Changes in sediment supply
39 and nearby urban and industrial development enhance vulnerability of sandy beaches, saltmarshes and
40 mangrove forests to sea-level rise (very high confidence). Mangroves continue to face multiple compounding
41 threats due to pollution, and conversion for aquaculture, agriculture or coastal infrastructure, in addition to
42 climate-based sea-level rise and coastal erosion. [confidence]. {3.3.3, 3.4.2, 5.9.3, 12.x}
43
44 B.2.4 Climate-driven changes to polar and sub-polar ecosystems are unprecedented, based on observations
45 from multiple knowledge systems. Persistent warming, combined with heatwaves, and loss of permafrost,
46 sea ice, and snow has contributed to cascading environmental and, in the Arctic, socio-cultural impacts,
47 including conversion of Arctic into boreal ecosystems, abrupt redistribution of species, and synchronous and
48 widespread bird, whale, and fish mortality. (high to very high confidence). {3.4.2, 5.7.3, 14.4.2, 14.4.4,
49 14.4.6, 14.4.7, 14.4.8, 14.4.11, Box 14.6, CCP6.2.1, CCP6.2.4, CCP6.2.5, CCP6.2.6, Cross-Chapter Box

52 B.2.5 Climate change has increased the extent and frequency of water-related diseases and harmful algal
53 blooms. They are threatening not only human and ecosystem health but also food security and the economy
54 and livelihoods of many coastal communities. (high confidence) {3.5, Box 3.3, 5.8.3, 5.9.4, 5.11.1, 5.12.3,
55 14.4.6, CCP6.2.8, Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2}
56
 
B.2 Ocean warming, with increases in the frequency and intensity of short-term marine heatwaves, ocean acidification, stratification, and deoxygenation are negatively impacting marine ecosystems and reducing fisheries productivity (high confidence). Findings are in line with the paleo-record which shows how global warming caused species to migrate poleward, how sea-level rise drowned coastal ecosystems, and how extreme warming and ocean deoxygenation caused mass extinctions. Local and regional non-climate hazards [examples] continue to worsen, and to be worsened by, observed impacts of climate change on marine life (very high confidence). {3.2, 3.4.2, 3.4.4, Box 3.1, 5.8.1, 5.9.1, Cross-Chapter Box MOVING SPECIES in Chapter 5, Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2, Cross-Chapter Box EXTREMES in Chapter 2, Figure SPM.1, Figure SPM.2}.
